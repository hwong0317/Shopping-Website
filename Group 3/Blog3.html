			<br/>
			<p> Undeniably classy and always on-trend, jumpsuits are the ultimate all-in-one in any woman’s wardrobe. However, deciding what shoes to wear with a jumpsuit can make or break your look.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Jumpsuits are perfect for those occasions when you want to look put together without putting in effort.</p>
			<br/>	
			<p>Whether you want to freshen up your go-to fashion or are taking your first dip in the world of jumpsuits, check out our guide on jumpsuit shoes and how to style them for every occasion below.</p>
			<br/>
			<div class="information1">
				<h2>How to style a jumpsuit with boots </h2>
				<br/>
				<p>When it comes to pairing a jumpsuit with boots, stick to ankle boots rather than knee-high or military styles to keep this look as elegant as possible. Chelsea boots have long been a fashion favourite due to their versatility, whether you’re heading out for a first date or running errands. They upgrade even the most simplistic of outfits.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>Add a stylish leather crossbody bag to your look, opting for a trendy faux snake print option if you want to glamorise the outfit.</p>
				<br/>
				<p> <b>Top Tip:</b> Going casual? Grab an oversized teddy jacket that’s both cosy and cute. For more upmarket events, you can never go wrong with a classy camel trench coat.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>What to buy:</b> Show off your inner fashionista by pairing your jumpsuit with simple but stylish black pull-on Chelsea boots. They’re an essential for your shoedrobe and can be worn with all kinds of looks.</p>

				<h2>How to style a jumpsuit with heels </h2>
				<br/>
				<p>Heels are many women’s go-to choice for dressy events and client meetings at work. Luckily for you, they look incredibly stylish when worn with a jumpsuit. Sleek patent or suede nude heels are a classic choice, suiting almost all styles of jumpsuit. Similarly, you can’t go wrong with strappy black heels.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>If you’re off on a night out, then a leather jacket will add some edge to this look but for those fancier occasions, you can’t go wrong with a more formal fitted blazer. If you want to add a pop of colour, then a bold clutch bag is the way to go – especially if the rest of your outfit is on the minimal side.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Top Tip:</b> Delicate drop earrings make a statement without looking brash, but don’t be afraid to be daring with a statement necklace – you do want to stand out from the crowd, after all.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>What to buy:</b> Dress up your jumpsuit with the Hallie nude heeled sandal or pretty patent court shoe in nude. These are the perfect size for those who want to wear heels while staying comfortable, so you can dance the night away.</p>

				<h2>How to style a jumpsuit with trainers </h2>
				<br/>
				<p>Comfortable, cute and casual, go for a minimal weekend look with a jumpsuit and trainers. Pick low top trainers that skim the bottom of your jumpsuit if you’re wearing a full-length style. Avoid high tops unless you’re wearing a very cropped suit, as this can actually make your legs look shorter.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Top Tip:</b>  Add a statement chunky collar necklace to add flair to this casual look, pairing it with your favourite sunnies or scarf depending on the weather.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>What to buy:</b> If you prefer to let your outfit do the talking, then these plain canvas shoes complement every outfit.</p>
				<br/>

				<h2>How to style jumpsuits with sandals</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>Perfect for those warm summer days, choose a lightweight jumpsuit when dining al fresco or heading out with the girls as the weather starts to heat up. If you’re wearing a cropped jumpsuit, choose strappy gladiator sandals that have decorative fastenings around the ankle. Otherwise, ultra-casual mule sandals are the way to go.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>This style pairs perfectly with round tortoiseshell sunnies, but don’t be afraid to reach for aviators if you prefer.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Top Tip:</b>  Keep the rest of your accessories neutral, choosing dainty earrings or a longline thin chain.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>What to buy:</b> If you tend to choose shoes with embellishments, then the plaited rose gold jewelled gladiator sandals are the perfect choice for you. These look great with cropped jumpsuits, adding some extra pizzazz that’ll instantly draw attention your way.</p>

				<h2>How to style jumpsuits with flats </h2>
				<br/>
				<p>Some occasions call for comfort, but that doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice on style. On the contrary, there are plenty of smart, sophisticated ballet pumps and flat shoes to wear with jumpsuits that’ll have you looking bang on trend.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Style your choice of flat shoe and jumpsuit with a chunky knit cardigan for a smart-casual look. Add a pair of hoop earrings and a backpack for a cute everyday outfit, swapping it for a tote bag to make it more suitable for a work environment.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Top Tip:</b>  Dress it up further with the addition of a glittering, eye-catching bangle or a pair of chandelier earrings.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>What to buy:</b> Our favourites include chic vintage-inspired patent loafers that are perfect for anywhere from the office to a laidback bar.</p>
				<br/>

				<h2>How to style jumpsuits with brogues </h2>
				<br/>
				<p>The perfect office-to-bar shoe, brogues are definitely an underrated option when it comes to suitable jumpsuit shoes. They’re comfortable, smart and trendy, making them a go-to for numerous occasions. Style these shoes with a fitted blazer to show off your figure, choosing either a stark white or black style depending on the colour of your jumpsuit. If your jumpsuit is black or white, however, don’t be afraid to experiment with colour by choosing a red or cobalt blue number instead. </p>
				<br/>
				<p>Jewellery wise, we’d stay away from anything overly chunky or bold, choosing more elegant drop necklaces and keeping it minimal.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>Top Tip:</b>  Add a tote bag and you’ll be able to head straight from work to drinks with the girls.</p>
				<br/>
				<p><b>What to buy:</b> Pair your jumpsuit with black patent lace-up brogue shoes. They’re perfect if you want to look sleek but aren’t a fan of heels.</p>
